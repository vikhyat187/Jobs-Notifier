# Jobs-Notifier

Jobs Notifier is an innovative application designed to provide students with easy access to on-campus placement schedules. By digitizing the process, we aim to create a centralized platform that lists all upcoming placement events, enabling students to prepare and plan effectively.

Traditionally, on-campus placement information is distributed through various channels, such as notice boards or emails, which can be cumbersome and easily overlooked. Jobs Notifier simplifies this process by consolidating all placement schedules in one place, making them readily available to students anytime, anywhere.

With Jobs Notifier, students can easily browse through upcoming placement events, including details like date, time, company, and job profiles. The application offers a user-friendly interface, allowing students to filter and search for specific opportunities based on their preferences.
